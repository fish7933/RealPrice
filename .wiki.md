# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator designed for businesses that need precise shipping cost estimates. It assesses various parameters, including the port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional expenses, to optimize logistics operations. The tool features an intuitive interface that allows users to calculate and compare freight costs across different methods, thereby improving decision-making and operational efficiency in logistics. Recent enhancements have been made to the management of version history, ensuring that only super admins can delete records, thereby maintaining data integrity.

# Project Module Description
The main module, `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, allows users to compute shipping costs, manage inputs, and display results in a tabbed format. It includes features for reviewing historical calculations and selecting sea freight options while enabling users to exclude specific cost types. The `TimeMachineDialog` component has been upgraded for a more user-friendly experience when selecting historical dates for cost calculations. The `AdminDashboard` module provides management capabilities for various freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs. The recent updates include improved UI for the time machine and enhanced formatting for monetary values, as well as stricter permissions for deleting version history.
