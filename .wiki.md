# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight cost calculator tailored for logistics companies, providing precise shipping cost estimates by analyzing parameters such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional charges. It enhances decision-making and operational efficiency in logistics, allowing users to calculate and compare freight costs across various shipping methods. Recent updates have focused on improving the user interface and enhancing the Cost Input Form for better organization and usability.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: Core component for calculating and displaying freight costs with a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Interface for managing freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays statistics of sea freight agents.
- **DTHCTable**: Manages Destination Terminal Handling Charge (D/O) entries and their versions.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Manages combined freight rates and their details.
- **BorderDestinationTable**: Manages freight rates for border destinations.
- **WeightSurchargeTable**: Manages rules for weight surcharges.
- **DPCostTable**: Manages direct port cost information.
- **CostCalculatorHeader**: Header component for the cost calculator.
- **CostResultTable**: Displays results of cost calculations, recently updated for better usability.
- **CalculationHistory**: Manages and displays historical calculation data.
- **SeaFreightDialog**: Dialog for selecting sea freight options.
- **CostInputForm**: Recently updated form for inputting cost-related data, utilizing a card layout for improved organization and additional features.
