# Project Summary
This project is an advanced freight cost calculator tailored for logistics companies, enhancing operational efficiency by delivering accurate shipping cost estimations. It incorporates various factors such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional fees. Users can compute and compare freight costs across different shipping methods, facilitating informed decision-making. Recent improvements have been made to the freight operations, including enhanced handling of port border freights and audit logs.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: Main component for freight cost calculation using a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Manages freight-related data such as agents and ports.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays statistics for sea freight agents.
- **ShippingLineTable**: Manages and displays shipping line details.
- **DTHCTable**: Handles Destination Terminal Handling Charge (D/O) entries.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Manages combined freight rates.
- **BorderDestinationTable**: Manages freight rates for border destinations with batch operation capabilities and improved input handling.
- **WeightSurchargeTable**: Handles weight surcharge rules.
- **DPCostTable**: Manages direct port cost information.
- **CostCalculatorHeader**: Header component for the cost calculator.
- **CostResultTable**: Displays optimized cost calculation results with improved cost breakdown.
- **CalculationHistory**: Manages and shows historical calculation data.
- **SeaFreightDialog**: Dialog for selecting sea freight options.
- **CostInputForm**: Form for inputting cost-related data.
- **RailAgentTable**: Displays rail freight agents.
- **TruckAgentTable**: Displays truck freight agents.
- **LoginForm**: User authentication form.
- **TimeMachineDialog**: Dialog for selecting historical dates for freight rate changes.
- **QuotationDialog**: Generates quotations based on calculated costs and exports to Excel.
- **AuditLogTable**: Manages and displays audit logs of freight-related changes, now with improved handling of destination IDs.
