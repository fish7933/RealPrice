# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight management system designed to optimize logistics and shipping operations across various transportation modes, including sea, rail, and truck freight. It provides functionalities such as cost calculation, user account management, quotation generation, and historical data tracking, significantly enhancing decision-making processes. By improving efficiency and transparency in the freight industry, the system ultimately helps businesses reduce costs and streamline operational workflows.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Manages user authentication and role assignments.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs based on user inputs and supports historical data.
- **Audit Logging**: Records changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Manages freight-related data entities, including DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port Border Table**: Manages port-to-port freight rates for rail transport.
- **Border Destination Table**: Handles freight rates for truck transport across various destinations.
- **Audit Log Table**: Displays and manages freight audit logs.
- **Combined Freight Table**: Manages combined freight rates and operations.
