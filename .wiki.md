# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator designed to provide users with accurate shipping cost estimates based on various parameters such as port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional charges. It aims to streamline the logistics process for businesses by offering a user-friendly interface for calculating and comparing freight costs across different shipping options.

# Project Module Description
The main module is the `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, which handles the calculation of shipping costs, manages user input, and displays results in a tabbed interface. It supports features like viewing historical calculations, selecting sea freight options, and excluding specific cost types from calculations.
