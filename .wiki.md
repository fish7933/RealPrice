# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator designed for businesses that require accurate shipping cost estimates. It evaluates various factors, such as the port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional expenses, to streamline logistics operations. The tool features a user-friendly interface that allows users to calculate and compare freight costs across different shipping methods, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency in logistics.

# Project Module Description
The primary module, `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, enables users to calculate shipping costs, manage inputs, and present results in a tabbed format. It includes features for reviewing historical calculations and selecting sea freight options while allowing users to exclude specific cost types. The `TimeMachineDialog` component has been enhanced for a better user experience when selecting historical dates for cost calculations. The `AdminDashboard` module offers management capabilities for various freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs. Recent updates have improved the UI for the time machine and added formatting for monetary values.
