# Project Summary
This project is an advanced freight cost calculator tailored for logistics companies, designed to optimize the estimation of shipping costs based on various parameters such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional fees. It enhances operational efficiency and decision-making by allowing users to calculate and compare freight costs across diverse shipping methods. Recent updates have improved functionality, including the addition of a method for retrieving audit logs, comprehensive shipping line management, and enhanced data handling through integration with Supabase.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: Core component for calculating and displaying freight costs with a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Interface for managing freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays statistics of sea freight agents.
- **ShippingLineTable**: Manages and displays shipping line information.
- **DTHCTable**: Manages Destination Terminal Handling Charge (D/O) entries and their versions.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Manages combined freight rates and their details.
- **BorderDestinationTable**: Manages freight rates for border destinations.
- **WeightSurchargeTable**: Manages rules for weight surcharges.
- **DPCostTable**: Manages direct port cost information.
- **CostCalculatorHeader**: Header component for the cost calculator.
- **CostResultTable**: Displays results of cost calculations, updated for better usability.
- **CalculationHistory**: Manages and displays historical calculation data.
- **SeaFreightDialog**: Dialog for selecting sea freight options.
- **CostInputForm**: Updated form for inputting cost-related data, organized in a card layout with enhanced features.
- **RailAgentTable**: Manages and displays rail freight agents with add/edit/delete functionalities.
- **TruckAgentTable**: Manages and displays truck freight agents with add/edit/delete functionalities.
- **LoginForm**: User authentication form for logging into the application, now updated for improved user experience.
- **TimeMachineDialog**: Allows users to select historical dates for viewing freight rate changes.
