# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator designed for logistics businesses, providing precise shipping cost estimates based on parameters like port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional costs. This tool improves decision-making and operational efficiency in logistics by allowing users to calculate and compare freight costs across various methods. The recent updates have focused on enhancing the user interface, modernizing data management components, and improving user experience through better visual elements and animations.

# Project Module Description
The main module, `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, allows users to compute shipping costs while managing inputs and displaying results in a tabbed interface. Key features include:
- Review of historical calculations and selection of sea freight options.
- Upgraded `TimeMachineDialog` for intuitive historical date selection.
- Enhanced `AdminDashboard` for managing freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs, with improved usability.
