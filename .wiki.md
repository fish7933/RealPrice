# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator designed for businesses that need precise shipping cost estimates. It takes into account various parameters such as the port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional charges to streamline logistics processes. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to calculate and compare freight costs across different shipping options, ultimately enhancing decision-making in logistics management.

# Project Module Description
The primary module is `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, which facilitates shipping cost calculations, manages user inputs, and presents results in a tabbed format. It features options for viewing historical calculations, selecting sea freight options, and excluding specific cost types. The `TimeMachineDialog` component has been improved to enhance user experience when selecting historical dates for cost calculations.
