# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight cost calculator designed for logistics companies to provide precise shipping cost estimates. It factors in various parameters such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional charges. This tool significantly improves decision-making and operational efficiency in logistics by allowing users to calculate and compare freight costs across multiple shipping methods. Recent updates have enhanced the user interface with modern gradients, animations, and improved visual hierarchy, further enriching the user experience.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: Facilitates shipping cost calculations with a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Modernized interface for managing freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays sea freight agents and their statistics.
- **DTHCTable**: Manages D/O (Destination Terminal Handling Charge) entries and their versions.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Manages combined freight rates and their details.
