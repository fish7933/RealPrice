# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight management system designed to optimize logistics and shipping operations across various transportation modes, including sea, rail, and truck freight. It provides businesses with essential tools for cost calculation, user account management, quotation generation, and historical data tracking, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and transparency.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Handles user authentication and role assignments.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs and maintains historical data.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Manages freight-related data entities, including DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port and Destination Tables**: Manages freight rates for rail and truck transport across various destinations.
- **Combined Freight Table**: Handles combined freight rates and operations.
- **Freight Calculator**: Provides a user interface for calculating freight estimates.
- **Cost Input Form**: Allows users to input additional costs for freight calculations, including domestic transport costs.
- **Cost Result Table**: Displays results of freight calculations and cost breakdowns.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays user statistics and recent calculations.
- **Agent Management**: Manages rail and truck agents with a focus on usability.
- **Time Machine Dialog**: Allows users to select historical dates and view corresponding freight audit logs.
