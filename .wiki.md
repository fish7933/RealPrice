# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator tailored for logistics businesses, offering accurate shipping cost estimates based on factors such as port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional fees. This tool enhances decision-making and operational efficiency in logistics by enabling users to calculate and compare freight costs across various methods. Recent updates have focused on modernizing the user interface with stunning gradients, animations, and improved visual hierarchy to elevate user experience.

# Project Module Description
The main module, `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, facilitates shipping cost computations while managing inputs and displaying results in a tabbed interface. Key features include:
- Historical calculation review and selection of sea freight options.
- Enhanced `TimeMachineDialog` for intuitive historical date selection.
- Upgraded `AdminDashboard` for managing freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs, with improved usability.
- New `AgentSeaFreightTable` with modern gradient headers and comprehensive statistics.
