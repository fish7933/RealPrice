# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight management system designed to optimize logistics and shipping operations across various transport modes, including sea, rail, and truck. It provides businesses with essential tools for cost calculations, user account management, quotation generation, and historical data tracking. Recent updates have enhanced the accuracy of Delivery Order (D/O) charge filtering, introduced a feature for tracking historical freight calculations through a Time Machine dialog, and improved data integrity with a new `snapshot` column.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Manages user authentication and role assignments.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs and maintains historical data.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Handles freight-related data entities, including DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port and Destination Tables**: Manages freight rates for rail and truck transport across various destinations.
- **Combined Freight Table**: Handles combined freight rates and operations.
- **Freight Calculator**: Provides a user interface for calculating freight estimates.
- **Cost Input Form**: Allows users to input additional costs for freight calculations.
- **Cost Result Table**: Displays results of freight calculations and cost breakdowns.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays user statistics and recent calculations.
- **Agent Management**: Manages rail and truck agents with a focus on usability.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides management functionalities for agents, ports, destinations, and more.
- **Time Machine Dialog**: Enables users to select historical dates and view corresponding freight audit logs.
- **Quotation Management**: Manages quotations, including history, pagination, filtering, and features for viewing, exporting, and note management.
