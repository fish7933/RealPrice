# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight management system designed to optimize logistics and shipping operations across various transportation modes, including sea, rail, and truck freight. It enhances decision-making through features such as cost calculation, user account management, quotation generation, and historical data tracking. The system aims to improve efficiency and transparency in the freight industry, assisting businesses in reducing costs and streamlining workflows.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Manages user authentication, role assignments, and user-related operations.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs based on user inputs and maintains historical data.
- **Audit Logging**: Keeps track of changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Handles freight-related data entities, including DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port and Destination Tables**: Manages freight rates for rail and truck transport across various destinations.
- **Combined Freight Table**: Manages combined freight rates and operations.
- **Freight Calculator**: Provides a user interface for calculating freight estimates.
- **Cost Input Form**: Allows users to input additional costs for freight calculations.
- **Cost Result Table**: Displays the results of freight calculations and cost breakdowns.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays user statistics and recent calculations.
