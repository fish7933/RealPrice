# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator tailored for businesses that require accurate shipping cost estimates. It evaluates various parameters such as the port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional expenses to enhance logistics operations. The tool features a user-friendly interface that enables users to calculate and compare freight costs across multiple methods, thus facilitating better decision-making and improving operational efficiency in logistics. Recent updates have focused on modernizing the design of the data management tabs and enhancing user experience through improved UI elements and animations.

# Project Module Description
The primary module, `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, allows users to compute shipping costs while managing inputs and displaying results in a tabbed interface. Key features include:
- Historical calculation review and selection of sea freight options.
- The `TimeMachineDialog` component has been upgraded for a more intuitive experience when selecting historical dates.
- The `AdminDashboard` module has been enhanced to manage freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs, with improved UI for better usability.
