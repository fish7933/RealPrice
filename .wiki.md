# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight management system designed to optimize logistics and shipping operations across multiple transportation modes, including sea, rail, and truck freight. It provides functionalities for cost calculation, user account management, and quotation generation, along with historical data tracking to improve decision-making processes. The system aims to enhance efficiency and transparency in the freight industry, ultimately benefiting businesses by reducing costs and improving operational workflows.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Handles user authentication and role assignments.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs based on user inputs, with support for historical data.
- **Audit Logging**: Records changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Manages freight-related data entities, such as DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port Border Table**: Manages port-to-port freight rates for rail transport.
- **Border Destination Table**: Handles freight rates for truck transport across various destinations.
- **Audit Log Table**: Displays and manages freight audit logs.
