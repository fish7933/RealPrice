# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator that provides businesses with accurate shipping cost estimates based on parameters such as the port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional charges. It aims to enhance the logistics process by offering a user-friendly interface for calculating and comparing freight costs across various shipping options.

# Project Module Description
The main module is the `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, which manages shipping cost calculations, user input, and displays results in a tabbed interface. It includes features for viewing historical calculations, selecting sea freight options, and excluding specific cost types from calculations. The `TimeMachineDialog` component has been updated to improve the user experience when selecting historical dates for cost calculations.
