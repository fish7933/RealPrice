# Project Summary
This project is an advanced freight cost calculator tailored for logistics companies, aimed at enhancing operational efficiency through accurate shipping cost estimations. It integrates various factors such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional fees to compute and compare freight costs across diverse shipping methods. This empowers users to make informed decisions. Recent updates include support for port border freights and improved audit logging capabilities, along with enhanced user interfaces for better usability.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: Core component for freight cost calculation with a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Interface for managing freight-related data such as agents and ports.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays statistics for sea freight agents.
- **ShippingLineTable**: Manages and displays details about shipping lines.
- **DTHCTable**: Manages Destination Terminal Handling Charge (D/O) entries.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Handles combined freight rates.
- **BorderDestinationTable**: Manages freight rates for border destinations with batch operation capabilities.
- **WeightSurchargeTable**: Manages weight surcharge rules.
- **DPCostTable**: Manages direct port cost information.
- **CostCalculatorHeader**: Header component for the cost calculator.
- **CostResultTable**: Displays optimized cost calculation results with a detailed breakdown.
- **CalculationHistory**: Manages and shows historical calculation data.
- **SeaFreightDialog**: Dialog for selecting sea freight options.
- **CostInputForm**: Form for inputting cost-related data.
- **RailAgentTable**: Displays rail freight agents.
- **TruckAgentTable**: Displays truck freight agents.
- **LoginForm**: User authentication form.
- **TimeMachineDialog**: Dialog for selecting historical dates for freight rate changes.
- **QuotationDialog**: Generates quotations based on calculated costs and exports to Excel.
- **AuditLogTable**: Manages and displays audit logs of freight-related changes.
- **PortBorderTable**: Manages freight rates for border crossings, now includes POL dropdown functionality.
