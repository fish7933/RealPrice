# Project Summary
This project is an advanced freight cost calculator designed for logistics companies to optimize shipping cost estimations. By considering parameters such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional fees, the application enhances operational efficiency and decision-making. Users can calculate and compare freight costs across various shipping methods. Recent updates have improved data persistence with Supabase and enhanced user experience in the CostResultTable component, which now features a more intuitive display of the lowest cost options.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: Core component for calculating and displaying freight costs with a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Interface for managing freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays statistics of sea freight agents.
- **ShippingLineTable**: Manages and displays shipping line information.
- **DTHCTable**: Manages Destination Terminal Handling Charge (D/O) entries and their versions.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Manages combined freight rates and their details.
- **BorderDestinationTable**: Manages freight rates for border destinations.
- **WeightSurchargeTable**: Manages rules for weight surcharges.
- **DPCostTable**: Manages direct port cost information.
- **CostCalculatorHeader**: Header component for the cost calculator.
- **CostResultTable**: Displays results of cost calculations, optimized for usability, now highlighting the lowest cost with a new "BEST" label and sparkle animation.
- **CalculationHistory**: Manages and displays historical calculation data.
- **SeaFreightDialog**: Dialog for selecting sea freight options.
- **CostInputForm**: Updated form for inputting cost-related data, organized in a card layout.
- **RailAgentTable**: Manages and displays rail freight agents, including agent codes.
- **TruckAgentTable**: Manages and displays truck freight agents, including agent codes.
- **LoginForm**: User authentication form, updated for improved user experience.
- **TimeMachineDialog**: Enhanced dialog for selecting historical dates for viewing freight rate changes, now utilizing updated freight audit logs.
- **PortBorderTable**: Manages freight rates for border crossings, enhanced for better functionality.
