# Project Summary
The project is an advanced freight management system aimed at optimizing logistics and shipping operations across various transportation modes, including sea, rail, and truck freight. It offers features for cost calculation, user account management, and quotation generation, while also enabling historical data tracking to enhance decision-making processes.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Manages user authentication and role assignments.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs based on user inputs, with support for historical data.
- **Audit Logging**: Records changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Oversees freight-related data entities, such as DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port Border Table**: Manages port-to-port freight rates for rail transport.
- **Border Destination Table**: Handles freight rates for truck transport across various destinations.
