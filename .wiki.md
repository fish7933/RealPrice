# Project Summary
This project is an advanced freight cost calculator designed specifically for logistics companies, aiming to enhance operational efficiency through accurate shipping cost estimations. It factors in elements such as ports of loading (POL), ports of discharge (POD), weight, and additional fees. Recent updates have focused on improving user feedback mechanisms, robust validation for POL selection, and advanced management features for freight data, including batch deletion and version control for freight rates. Additionally, audit logging for freight operations has been upgraded, ensuring better tracking and accountability, now with features for Excel export and version comparison.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **CostCalculatorWithTabs**: The main component for freight cost calculation featuring a tabbed interface.
- **AdminDashboard**: Interface for managing freight-related data, including agents and ports.
- **AgentSeaFreightTable**: Displays statistics for sea freight agents.
- **ShippingLineTable**: Manages details about shipping lines.
- **DTHCTable**: Handles Destination Terminal Handling Charge (D/O) entries.
- **CombinedFreightTable**: Manages combined freight rates.
- **BorderDestinationTable**: Handles freight rates for border destinations with batch operations.
- **WeightSurchargeTable**: Manages weight surcharge rules.
- **DPCostTable**: Manages direct port cost information.
- **CostCalculatorHeader**: Header component for the cost calculator.
- **CostResultTable**: Displays optimized cost calculation results with detailed breakdowns.
- **CalculationHistory**: Manages and shows historical calculation data.
- **SeaFreightDialog**: Dialog for selecting sea freight options.
- **CostInputForm**: Form for inputting cost-related data.
- **RailAgentTable**: Displays rail freight agents.
- **TruckAgentTable**: Displays truck freight agents.
- **LoginForm**: User authentication form.
- **TimeMachineDialog**: Dialog for selecting historical dates for freight rate changes.
- **QuotationDialog**: Generates quotations based on calculated costs and exports to Excel.
- **AuditLogTable**: Manages and displays audit logs of freight-related changes, now with Excel export and version comparison features.
- **PortBorderTable**: Manages freight rates for border crossings, including enhanced validation for POL.
