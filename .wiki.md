# Project Summary
This project is an advanced freight management system designed to optimize logistics and shipping operations across multiple transport modes, such as sea, rail, and truck. It provides logistics companies with essential tools for managing cost calculations, user accounts, quotations, and historical data tracking, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. Recent updates have improved the validation process for cost calculations, particularly for destinations like KASHGAR, and enhanced diagnostics for troubleshooting freight detection issues.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Management**: Handles user authentication and role assignments.
- **Freight Calculation**: Computes freight costs and maintains historical records.
- **Audit Logging**: Monitors changes to freight data for traceability.
- **Data Management**: Manages freight-related data entities such as DTHC, DPCost, and weight surcharge rules.
- **Port and Destination Tables**: Manages freight rates for rail and truck transport across various destinations.
- **Combined Freight Table**: Handles operations related to combined freight rates.
- **Freight Calculator**: Interface for estimating freight costs.
- **Cost Input Form**: Allows users to input additional costs for calculations.
- **Cost Result Table**: Displays results and breakdowns of freight calculations, including detailed missing freight messages.
- **User Dashboard**: Presents user statistics and recent calculations.
- **Agent Management**: Manages rail and truck agents.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides functionalities for managing agents, ports, and destinations.
- **Time Machine Dialog**: Enables users to select historical dates and view corresponding freight audit logs.
- **Quotation Management**: Manages quotations, including history, pagination, filtering, viewing, exporting, and memo management.
