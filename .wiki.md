# Project Summary
The project is a freight cost calculator aimed at businesses needing precise shipping cost estimates. It evaluates various factors such as the port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), weight, and additional expenses to streamline logistics. The tool offers a user-friendly interface for calculating and comparing freight costs across multiple shipping methods, thereby improving logistics decision-making and operational efficiency.

# Project Module Description
The main module is `CostCalculatorWithTabs`, which allows users to calculate shipping costs, manage inputs, and present results in a tabbed interface. It incorporates features for reviewing historical calculations, selecting sea freight options, and excluding specific cost types. Enhancements have been made to the `TimeMachineDialog` component for a better user experience when selecting historical dates for cost calculations. The `AdminDashboard` module provides management capabilities for various freight-related data, including agents, ports, and costs.
